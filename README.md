_“Possibly human. Definitely dev.”_

I'm a web developer who likes his code clean, his tools sharp, and his snacks crunchy.
I work with modern stacks (think: Symfony, Nuxt, Tailwind, TypeScript...) and I love building custom, human-focused digital things that actually work — and look damn good doing it.

## 🎮 Current status:

- 🧱 Full-stack web tinkerer
- 🏠 Based in France (where the bread is better than your CDN)
- 🧪 Co-founder of [twini](https://github.com/agence-twini) — a digital lab with pixels and purpose
- 🛠️ Writing code that looks better than my handwriting
- 💡 Building tools nobody asked for, but everybody ends up using

---

## 🔍 Debugging my personality with:

```js
const profile = {
  skills: ['Nuxt', 'Vue', 'Symfony', 'Tailwind', 'TypeScript', 'Stimulus', 'Turbo'],
  traits: ['debugger whisperer', 'pixel perfectionist', 'terminal romantic'],
  weaknesses: ['dark mode bias', 'coffee overclocking'],
  motto: 'Who controls the Internet, controls the World...'
};
```

---

## 🧠 Knowledge & chaos

```bash
❯ npx create-app --template custom --auth symfony --front nuxt
✔ looks good
✔ deploys fast
✔ made with care
```

I don’t do boilerplates. I **boil the plate**, forge a better one, then publish it in open source for fun.

## 🧌 Fun (but mostly true) facts

- I once renamed a file 8 times to find the perfect name. Twice.
- I see semicolons in my dreams.
- I like my UI like I like my jokes: **snappy**.
- I’ve made a CLI just to launch my coffee machine (yes, really).
- I believe every repo deserves a `README.md` that slaps.

```bash
$ curl -s https://twispr.sh | bash
